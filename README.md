# Simple UUID Server

A lightweight Python service for minting and retrieving **stable UUIDs** based on a
namespace, entity type, and a small set of metadata fields.

The service is intended for internal or research infrastructure use, where the same
conceptual entity must always resolve to the same UUID. It is designed to run as a
long-lived Linux service behind a reverse proxy.

A primary use case for the service is the generation of stable UUIDs during data transformation and mapping workflows, for example when producing XML or RDF for ingestion into semantic systems such as [ResearchSpace](https://researchspace.org/)  or [Arches for Science](https://www.archesproject.org/arches-for-science/).

In these scenarios, source data may be processed in multiple passes or across different pipelines, and consistent UUIDs are required to ensure that entities and their relationships are correctly aligned when constructing a connected semantic dataset.

The identifiers generated by this service are intended for use within specific
applications and data processing workflows, including resolution to data
representations within those applications. A primary example is supporting
consistent internal linking when constructing semantic datasets.

They are not intended to replace institutional or more generally resolvable
persistent identifiers (such as DOIs, IGSNs, or collection identifiers), which serve
a different role in representing and resolving entities at an institutional or public
level. Where entities are also assigned institutional or persistent identifiers, those
identifiers should be retained and referenced alongside the UUIDs rather than
replaced.

## Quick Start (Local)

For local testing only (not production):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RICHeS-UKRI/simple-uuid-server.git
cd simple-uuid-server

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

export UUID_SERVICE_API_KEY=test-key
export UUID_DB_FILE=./uuid_registry.db

gunicorn -w 1 -b 127.0.0.1:8001 app.uuid_service:app
```

## Typical use case

The service is commonly used during data mapping and transformation workflows, where
identifiers must be generated deterministically rather than randomly. For example,
when mapping collection or research data into XML or RDF for ingestion into semantic
platforms such as [ResearchSpace](https://researchspace.org/) or [Arches for Science](https://www.archesproject.org/arches-for-science/), the same conceptual entity may appear in multiple
source tables, files, or processing stages.

By generating UUIDs based on a shared namespace and a small set of identifying
metadata, the service ensures that repeated references to the same entity resolve
to a single, consistent identifier, allowing relationships within the resulting
semantic dataset to align correctly.
